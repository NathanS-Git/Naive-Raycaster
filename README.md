# Naive Raycaster
This project was a very basic introduction for myself into rendering on a computer screen. This utilizes the very old method DOOM used. It sends out *n* amount of rays from the camera, and the distance they intersect with an object at, you draw a rectangle of width *delta d*, and height corresponding to the distance. This creates the illusion of a first person view.

You can change the view in the running program by pressing 'v'.
